## Application Usage

Usage of the application is very simple. It allows users to add important Notes that they may want to keep for different reasons. This application by no means has been designed to replace existing tools such as Outlook, they have been designed to demonstrate that we understand the process of building a Server front end applicaiton in Node and Express JS.

1. Start by clicking on the Get Started.
2. Enter a new Note - Title and contents.
3. Click on the <span style="color:brown;">Save</span> icon (top right of screen).
4. To <span style="color:brown;">Delete</span> an existing note click on the Trash can.

Note gets saved in the db.json file and all notes are displayed. You may make any Note active, but they are marked as read-only. Perhaps in future versions I will allow user to edit and save existing Notes.
